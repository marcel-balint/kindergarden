                        We believe children should stay children as long as they
                        need and the fact that they enter 1st grade should not
                        end their childhood. We intertwine playing and learning
                        at such an early age and encourage our students to enjoy
                        learning.

                    <h2>About Us</h2>
                    <p>We began as a visionary venture in 1998 when Dr. Gabriel
                        and Alish Black, world-class academics in the field of
                        economics, endeavored to find a way to prepare students
                        for college and the real world better than schools did
                        at the time. They quickly found that the best way to
                        make students thrive was simple: challenge them. After
                        opening their first school in 1998, the Blocks
                        discovered that students, when given a well-crafted
                        curriculum and teachers who truly cared about teaching
                        it, were able to learn at exceedingly high levels,
                        meeting and surpassing the best students in the world.
                        What began as a single campus has grown to become a
                        unique, high-achieving, and unprecedented network of
                        schools.</p>
